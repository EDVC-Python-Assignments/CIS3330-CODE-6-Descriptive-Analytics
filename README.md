# CIS3330-CODE-6-Descriptive-Analytics
## Instructions

In this CODE assignment, you will begin your business analytics training. This CODE assignment has the following two parts:

1. Python code implementation for producing descriptive statistics and annual reports of the big mac index.
  + Implement in the file **'code_6.py'** the code for the following functions
    + `get_describe_country`
      * The function receives a country code and calculates descriptive statistics for the country's data.
      * The function returns the descriptive statistics for the country.
    + `get_country_groupby_year`
      * The function receives a country code and calculates a report (e.g., descriptive statistics) that is aggregated by year
      * The function returns the report by year.
    + This part of the assignment will have automated grading on GitHub Classrooms.
2. Report on descriptive analytics that compares the big mac prices of five countries.
  + Post a question that can be answered using descriptive analytics.
  + Answer your descriptive analytics question by using the code implemented in **Part 1** of this assignment, other code you implement (optional) and the visualizations we learned in Week 8.
  + Include all the programming code for this part of the assignment inside the `if __name__ == "__main__":` statement.
  + Create a report in Word or Jupyter notebooks.
  + Upload your report to both this code repository and to Blackboard.
